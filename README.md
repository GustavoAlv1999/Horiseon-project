# Horiseon-project
Horiseon was given to me in an unaccessible state. I was tasked with giving it SEO. 
Throughout the entire project I found many unecessary indentations, extra tags, and over use of css selectors. 
I not only corrected the indentations, but included semantic elements as well for people with descritive browsers.
I added alt tags, and grouped together the plethora of unecessory css selectors overral increasing my SEO.
